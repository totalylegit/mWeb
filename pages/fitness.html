      <p>For the past 75 days, I have been following a fitness streak inspired by David Goggins. My routine includes daily pushups, long-distance running, and swimming. This regimen has significantly improved my physical endurance and mental toughness. Each day, I challenge myself to push beyond my limits, embracing the discomfort that comes with intense exercise. The combination of these activities not only enhances my cardiovascular health but also builds muscle strength and resilience. Staying consistent with this streak has taught me the value of discipline and perseverance in achieving fitness goals.</p>

  <!--Push ups-->

      <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Push Ups</h3>
      <p>Push-ups are a fundamental exercise that targets multiple muscle groups, including the chest, shoulders, triceps, and core. They are an excellent way to build upper body strength and endurance. To perform a proper push-up, start in a plank position with your hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor, then push back up to the starting position. Variations such as incline push-ups, decline push-ups, and diamond push-ups can be incorporated to target different muscle areas and increase the challenge. Consistently including push-ups in your fitness routine can lead to improved muscle tone and overall upper body strength.</p>

      <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Long Distance Running</h3>
      <p>Long-distance running is a cardiovascular exercise that enhances endurance, stamina, and overall heart health. It involves running distances typically ranging from 5 kilometers to marathons (42.195 kilometers). To prepare for long-distance running, it's essential to build a solid base of mileage gradually, incorporating rest days to allow for recovery. Proper footwear and running form are crucial to prevent injuries. Long-distance running not only improves physical fitness but also has mental health benefits, such as reducing stress and boosting mood through the release of endorphins. Setting achievable goals and tracking progress can help maintain motivation and commitment to this rewarding activity.</p>

  <!--Swimming-->

      <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Swimming</h3>
      <p>Swimming is a low-impact, full-body workout that provides numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and flexibility. It is an excellent exercise for people of all ages and fitness levels, as it is easy on the joints while still offering a challenging workout. Different swimming strokes, such as freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly, target various muscle groups and can be incorporated into a swimming routine for variety. Regular swimming sessions can help enhance lung capacity, reduce stress, and promote overall well-being. Whether swimming in a pool or open water, this activity is a fun and effective way to stay fit and healthy.</p>
