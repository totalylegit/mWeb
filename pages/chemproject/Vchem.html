            <h5 class="w3-center">A brief history of the atomic models from Dalton to Schrödinger</h5>
            <p class="w3-large">
              Dalton started atomic theory with his hypothesis that all matter is made of little balls called atoms. He laied out the properties of atoms in his postulate. 
            </p>
            <p class="w3-large">
              Next, J.J. Thomson discovered the electron and further refined the atomic model of Dalton. Thomson described the atom as a "plum pudding" with the liquid part being positively charged and the chunks of plum (the electron) being negatively charged. This was logical as Michael Faraday laid the ground work of electricity and polar opposites a century before Thomson.  
            </p>
            <p class="w3-large">
              After Thomson came Ernest Rutherford, who discovered the nucleus of the atom while trying to verify Thomson's model. Rutherford used the famous gold foil experiment and had calculated alpha particle pathes using Thomson's model. He and his team were surprised when there were major deviations until he came with his new model for the atom. Unfortunately, there are 3 major flaws with this model.
              <ul>
                <li>The electrons would spiral into the nucleus due to electromagnetic attraction.</li>
                <li>There was no explanation for the discrete lines in atomic emission spectra.</li>
                <li>It did not explain why some atoms were chemically inert while others were highly reactive.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="w3-large">
                The most advanced model of the atom came from Erwin Schrödinger in the 1920s, who developed the quantum mechanical model. Schrödinger's wave equation described electrons as wave-like entities rather than particles, leading to the concept of electron clouds or orbitals. This model provided a more accurate representation of atomic behavior and laid the foundation for modern chemistry and physics.
